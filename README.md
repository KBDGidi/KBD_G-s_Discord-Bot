## About the Project

This project is a discord bot, which is built to have fun, listen to music and to server some administrative purposes. The bot is based on the programming language JavaScript with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). 
<br>
The bot is hosted on my Homeserver. The bot is currently in development and will be updated. 
<br>
<br>
I created this project, because I wanted to have my own bot, which is able to play music and can do some other stuff, like sending memes from Reddit. 
<br>
Additionally I wanted to learn more about JavaScript and the discord.js library. The discord.js library is a great way to learn more about JavaScript, because it is very easy to use and has a lot of documentation.
<br>
One of the biggest "helpers" was the discord.api itself, because without their work I would not have been able to create slash-commands.
<br>
Great shoutout to the discord.js documentation on [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/), which helped me a lot to understand the library and to create the bot with JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
I would be very happy if you would like to use my bot and if you have any suggestions or ideas, please let me know. 
<br>
Get the bot [here](#invite).

Please give me a star, if you like my project. Thank you very much!
